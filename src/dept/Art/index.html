    <h3>Mandala Devine Art</h3>
    <p class="mandala-text">Mandala is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. The circular designs symbolizes the idea that life is never ending and everything is connected.
      Mayans, Aztecs, Australian aborigines and European Catholics all created mandalas in one form or another, but mandalas are most common in Buddhist and Hindu art of the Indian subcontinent.
      Traditionally, a mandala is a geometric design or pattern that represents the cosmos or deities in various heavenly worlds.
      Mandalas, meaning "circles" in Sanskrit, are sacred symbols that are used for meditation, prayer, healing and art therapy for both adults and children. Mandalas have been shown in
      clinical studies to boost the immune system, reduce stress and pain, lower blood pressure, promote sleep and ease depression.</p>

    <h3>Painting</h3>
    <p class="painting-text">Painting is an important form in the visual arts, bringing in elements such as drawing, composition, gesture, narration, and abstraction.

      Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface (called the "matrix" or "support").
      The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used.
      The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may
      incorporate multiple other materials, including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, and even whole objects.</p>

    <h3>Digital Art</h3>
    <p class="digital-art-text">
      Digital art is a general term for a range of artistic works and practices that use digital technology as an essential
      part of the creative and/or presentation process. Since the 1970s, various names have been used to describe the process
      including computer art and multimedia art, and digital art is
      itself placed under the larger umbrella term new media art. After some initial resistance, the impact of digital
      technology has transformed activities such as painting, drawing, sculpture and music/sound art, while new forms, such as net art,
      digital installation art, and virtual reality, have become recognized artistic practices. More generally the term digital artist is used to describe an artist who makes use of digital technologies in the production of art. In an expanded sense,
      "digital art" is a term applied to contemporary art that uses the methods of mass production or digital media.</p>

    <img class="sketch-art-img" src="src/Images/Types/sketch.jpeg">
    <h3>Sketch Art</h3>
    <p class="sketch-art-text">Sketch is traditionally a rough drawing or painting in which an artist notes down his preliminary ideas for a work that will eventually be realized with greater precision and detail. The term also applies to brief
      creative pieces that per se may have artistic merit.In a traditional sketch, the emphasis usually is laid on the general design and composition of the work and on overall feeling.


      There are three main types of functional sketches.
      ðŸ”¸The first type is known as a croquis.

      ðŸ”¸The second type is pochade.

      ðŸ”¸The third type is portraiture</p>

      <p class="p1-text">Hey, I am Simran Chawla, Head Coordinator of Art Department at In4mals Society. I am pursuing my BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from KIIT, Bhubaneswar. Art has always been a predominant part of my life. I had started my art career in Priya Gupta Academy of Art and put it on a pause after learning for 4 years in Rabindranath Vidyamandir Art School. I was indulged in many art activities and competitions since my childhood. Colours to charcoals, pencils to sketch pens, everything about art fascinates me so much. This pandemic gave an opportunity to learn a new form of art which is Digital Art. Since then, it has captured my interest. I feel so out of the world that how, with only one software and a pen, we can create so many beautiful and mesmerizing artworks. Indeed, it's not magic, it requires quite a lot of patience, hardwork and imagination. Also, it gives us the freedom to experiment with each and every brush or colour, which is not sometimes possible with manual painting.

      <p class="p2-text">Hi, I'm Ananya Das! I've been painting since I was 4. Colours fascinate me a lot and the thought that I can create something however I want to with all my imagination gave rise to my obsession regarding painting. At the
        beginning I was mostly into sketching and painting, but with time I also started doodling. Recently I have started working on digital illustrations and artworks. Since my childhood I have attended various drawing competitions and it played a
        major role in my growth in this field.</p>

      <p class="p3-text">I'm Rishi Singh,19 from Kolkata West Bengal. Being a b.tech student I hardly get time to peruse with my passion .I start my drawing career nearly 12 years ago around 2009 when I was just 7. I was the youngest in the class but
        yet got the support of all the class mates .Since then I started participating in all the art competition. I hardly thought about winning, for me participating was important but end up winning of occupying some position..I completed my
        diploma in fine arts from a renowned art institution in kolkata.It took me 11 years to do so.After completion of my diploma I thought of starting digital art at first I started drawing on my mother's phone but later on my father gifted me an
        ipad I learnt digital sketches by going through the tutorials present on the youtube..Now I draw on 'Clip Studion Paint' also knows as csp I have a speciality of drawing portraits and human figures. I am also trying to go for the deep
        learning of these digital art platforms to excel more. Instagram - "_soul__orb"</p>

      <p class="p4-text">Myself Abhinandan Sarkar, hailing from Hooghly, West Bengal. I did my schooling from Pearls of God, Hooghly. My interest is in the world of Art, Design and Culture. I completed upto 6th year of diploma in art through Bangiya
        Sangeet Parishad and Suro Bharati Sangeet Kala Kendra ,
        recently studying in KIIT University.
        My ambition is to work with such industries or in such platform where I can use my passion or knack to make my thoughts applicable in real life. Bounding myself only in painting field is not what I desire. I desire to explore the vast field
        of Art. My hobbies include painting, photography, calligraphy, exploring my true self, etc. I wish to learn innovative design thinking/designing process, Films and its making, cinematography,etc. My honesty to myself and my works, has brought
        me some achievements and wish to achieve more heights. I must admit that Iâ€™m greatly Inspired by late Satyajit Ray and his works, which are guiding me throughout my life.</p>
