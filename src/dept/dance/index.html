                    <p>Hi, I'm Suparna Roy Gupta, the dance coordinator of IN4MALS society. I began my dance career at DR. RUMPA SINHA'S NATYALAYA from the age of 2yr. I am doing a junior diploma course in Bharatnatyam also from Prayag Sangeet Vishwavidyalaya.
                        I have competed in many national level and state level competitions. I am skilled in contemporary, semi-classical and bollywood dance. Recently I'm co-ordinating the dance group of IN4MALS. I try to guide & motivate all the members
                        in our dance society. What I think about Dance is ,it is a form of expression that brings people together, allows them to be creative in new ways, and is a fantastic way to escape the stresses and cares of everyday life. When I
                        dance I am completely get released from the preoccupations and stresses of day to day life. I enjoy growth, and performing is a wonderful catalyst in which this can happen.</p>

                    <p>Hi, I'm Adyasha Mohanty. I am a professionally trained dancer and started my journey in dancing at the age of 5 years. Ever Since I watched bollywood actors dancing in movies, I wanted to do that. All thanks to my parents who supported
                        me and started giving me professional training since I was 4 years old. It's been more than 12-13 years since I am performing. I am professionally trained in Odissi but also perform in bollywood, semiclassical forms as well. I
                        have competed in many national and international level programs as well. I'm here in IN4MALS members of our dance team since 1-2 months & already took part in 2 projects. IN4MALS society has already given me the chance to be a
                        part of two projects which were done online because of the pandemic. I expect, as soon as things get normal, we'd meet offline, we will start performing on stage and my skills will be even more enhanced.</p>

                    <p>Hi, I'm Oshmita Sarkar. I'm a second year student of CSE. I have a specialization in bharatanatyam, folk, fusion and regional dances. I have participated in various competitions of the IIT's and have made it to the finals. I also took
                        part in the KORUS fest of KIIT and have been a part of various local projects of In4mals for its social media page and YouTube channel. For me, dance is like a spiritual purification. Every move, every beat creates an aura of positivity
                        within me. I have been a passionate dancer since childhood and still continue the learning process as I believe that learning must never stop. In4mals has provided me with a platform to showcase my individuality as well as the
                        tallents that I have achieved from continuous practices. I can firmly affirm that being a part of this society has helped me grow as a dancer and unleashed a new being within me.

                        use to do Hip Hop, Bollywood or Freestyle dancing. I've joined our society few months ago but have already taken part in few projects of dance and performed in various competitions with the help of that wide platform the IN4MALS
                        provided me. My love for dance has brought me here. The feeling that the steps of dance gave me is beyond my imagination and cannot be described in words. IN4MALS gave me the perfect stage and opportunity to rise. It gave me the
                        spark to continue my Dance after a break of two years I'm eger to learn more and improve my skills here.</p>
